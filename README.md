Flight Delay Analysis on Long-Haul Flights

This project focuses on analyzing delays in long-haul flights (>2000 km), specifically those with delays greater than 2 hours. The objective is to uncover delay patterns and evaluate which factors most strongly influence these events.

🔎 Project Scope
1. Flight Filtering

Only flights with:

Distance greater than 2000 km.

Delay greater than 2 hours.

2. Delay Analysis by Day of the Week

Grouping criterion: day of the week.

Evaluation of average delays to identify trends and peak delay days.

3. Identification of Predictor Variables

Exploration of potential predictors such as:

Month of the year

Departure time

Airline

Day of the week

Determination of which variable(s) best predict significant flight delays.

🎯 Objectives

Understand delay patterns on long-haul flights.

Provide insights into how temporal, operational, and airline-related factors contribute to delays.

Support data-driven strategies to mitigate future disruptions.

📊 Expected Outcomes

Clear visualizations of flight delay patterns.

Insights into which variables are most influential in predicting long delays.

A foundation for building predictive models to improve airline operations and passenger experience.
