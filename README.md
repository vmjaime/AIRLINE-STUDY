# AIRLINE-STUDY
**Flight Delay Analysis**
This project aims to study delays on long-haul flights (>2000 km) with delays of more than 2 hours. The analysis focuses on the following key points:

_Flight filtering:_

Only flights with a distance of more than 2000 km and with delays of more than 2 hours are selected.

_Study of delays according to the day of the week:_

A grouping criterion (e.g. day of the week) is chosen to analyse the average delays of the longest and most delayed flights.

_Identification of predictor variables:_

Available variables that could have a significant impact on the prediction of delays (e.g. month, departure time, airline, etc.) are identified and analysed. The objective is to determine which variable best predicts flight delays.

**This analysis is intended to help understand delay patterns on long flights and provide useful information on how different variables may influence the occurrence of these delays.**
